# String Encoding and Decoding Project (Flask)

## Description
This project provides functions for encoding and decoding strings using a custom integer-based encoding scheme. The encoding process groups characters into segments and transforms their ASCII values into integers, while the decoding process reconstructs the original string from these integers.

## Features
- Encode strings into a list of integers.
- Decode a list of integers back into the original string.
- Custom encoding scheme with detailed documentation.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

# String Encoding and Decoding CLI (test)
